# Developer Setup

Really I don't expect other developers for this project but I like to have this process saved for future projects.

Note that the organization/structure is significantly copied from [usaspending-website](https://github.com/fedspendingtransparency/usaspending-website) used for [beta.usaspending.org](https://beta.usaspending.gov/#/). 

## Text Editors
Text editors I use, you can use whatever:

* ReactJS Frontend: [Sublime Text 3](https://www.sublimetext.com/3)

Good, you can change text documents. Whoopie do. 

## Git

You can use whatever git interface of your choosing. I like:
 
* command-line for more functionality
* [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) for usual committing

Clone the latest `dev` branch.

## ReactJS

Get some [Node.JS](https://nodejs.org/en/)

    Installing react
    > npm init
    > npm install

And run things at `localhost:8080`:

    > npm start
